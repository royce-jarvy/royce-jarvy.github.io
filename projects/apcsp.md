As part of the AP Computer Science Principles curriculum, the creation of a simple app was required for the final performance task. The app was a culmination of the basic programming concepts we learned throughout the course including input/output, functions, and algorithms. In addition, we were required to create a video demonstrating the functionality of the program as well create a write-up to explain why our program meets the requirements. For more information of the performance task's rubric, it can be found here: [Rubric](https://apcentral.collegeboard.org/media/pdf/ap23-sg-computer-science-principles.pdf).

Though we were given an option to work with a partner, I chose to do this independently so I was responsible for all of the work. For my app, I decided to create something to name covalent compounds for chemistry. At the time, I was taking chemistry and I noticed some of my peers struggled with nomenclature for chemical compounds. It inspired me to create this app, though, I restricted it to a couple of elements and binary covalent compounds. On the left side, you can choose a 1st and 2nd element with 4 elements to choose from in each. The right side chooses the amount for the corresponding element. When you're done choosing, the name of the compound will show up in the textbox. There are known bugs where it doesn't register a change in name or amount.

When I took this class, I already had previous experiences with programming so a lot of the concepts weren't new to me. However, the experience with this project and the design process were still valuable because it encouraged me to apply what I know to create something on my own. Also, I'd say this experience gave some preparation when it comes to programming assignments and projects for college-level courses.
