# Challenges in Web Design
Building websites involve two primary components. The first is developing the back-end which focuses on the functionality and processes of the website. Whereas the second component, the front-end, is centered around the visuals and design of the website for users to see. As the back-end may seem more in-line with programming for the purpose of functionality, software engineers may find it a challenge to actually design a site in a way to captivate users while giving a satisfying experience.

# The Power of UI Frameworks
For that reason, the usage of UI frameworks (such as Bootstrap 5) become relevant in designing websites in a simpler way. But, what are UI frameworks? First let’s break down the words:

UI, or user interface, is simply the medium that allows users to interact with a computer, application, etc. Meanwhile, frameworks (in the context of programming) provide a foundation for developing software, be it pre-written code that can be modified or functions that automate a task. Combined together, UI frameworks refer to a collection of pre-built, web design components that are pre-written in HTML, CSS, and/or JavaScript which are the primary languages to build a website.

As such, these frameworks streamline and accelerate web design by providing programmers with already pre-written code to work with. As a result, programmers may opt to utilize UI frameworks as opposed to raw HTML and CSS due to the added complexity of formatting components by hand. 

From my personal experience, I found using UI frameworks to be easier than raw HTML and CSS. With raw HTML and CSS, I often found myself running through hoops just to get a specific design whereas I could just call a couple of specific classes with Bootstrap 5 to get the same result. I’d say the only “difficult” thing about utilizing UI frameworks is finding the right classes to use, but then again, finding the right things to use is something everyone encounters when learning a new programming language. I believe that this problem will resolve itself as I use it more.
